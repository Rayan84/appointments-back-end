- Ruby version 3.0.1
- RoR version 7.0.2.4

## Getting Started

The back-end application will receive POST requests to create user accounts, and reservations and GET requests to view scooters and reservations.
The base URL is: https://cryptic-anchorage-52984.herokuapp.com

If you want to view scooters you can call this endpoint:

/api/v1/items

To do the same but with reservations call this endpoint:

/api/v1/reserveds/:user_id

APIs endpoints will return content in JSON form with the following format:

```
For items:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "XS 420 model",
  "price": 100,
  "image": "image_url",
  "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "description": "This is an electric scooter, ...etc "
}

For reservations:
{
  "id": 1,
  "user_id": 1,
  "item_id": 1,
  "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
}
```

You can view the details for a specific scooter by calling this endpoint:

/api/v1/items/:id

Same for reservations:

/api/v1/reservations/:id

**If you need further information about the endpoints you can view the documentation navigating to `/api-docs`.

If you prefer to clone the project locally, you can also get to the docs by navigating to http://`domain`:`port`/api-docs. Where `domain` is the domain of your server and `port` is the port of your server.
For example, if your server is running on port 3000, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/api-docs.
There you will see a list of all endpoints and their descriptions.
